/**
 * <p>The <code>ResultAttribute</code> method annotation indicates that a <code>getXXX</code> or <code>isXXX</code> method is a <a href="../../structuredData.html">structured
 * result data</a> attribute on a {@link BusinessApplicationPlugin} or {@link ResultList}
 * class that has perRequestResultData=false.</p>
 *
 * <p>Result attributes are implemented as Java bean properties on the plug-in class or {@link ResultList} class.
 * The plug-in must implement a <code>getXXX</code> or <code>isXXX</code> property method for each result attribute. The
 * result attribute name is the name of the Java bean property. The return type can
 * only use the supported <a href="../../dataTypes.html">data types</a>. The result attributes will be converted by
 * the CPF to the correct representation in the output format or a string
 * representation of the value before being returned to the user.</p>
 *
 * <p>After execution of the plug-in the result attribute methods will be invoked to get the result attribute values.</p>
 *
 * <p>The following example shows the use of the annotation on a {@link BusinessApplicationPlugin} class.</p>
